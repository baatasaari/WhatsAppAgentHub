### ❌ FAILED (1/11 Tests)

#### Routing Conflicts Issue - FAIL
**Root Cause:** Vite middleware catch-all handler intercepting API routes
**Affected Endpoints:**
- `/api/health` - Returns HTML instead of JSON
- `/api/analytics/summary` - Returns HTML instead of JSON  
- `/api/embed/whatsapp/:apiKey` - Returns HTML instead of JSON
- `/api/conversation-flow/templates` - Returns HTML instead of JSON

**Impact:** Limited - Core functionality unaffected, specific endpoints need routing fix
